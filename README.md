- Hi, Iâ€™m Sayan.
- I am a PhD student at INRIA and Ecole Polytechnique in France. 
- My research interests are differential privacy, privacy-preserving machine learning, federated learning, and privacy-utility optimization. 
- Contacts: +33 76 60 41 984, bizwas05@gmail.com.
- I study, talk, do, and preach mathematics most of the time. When not, I play chess, cricket, badminton, and board games. I like to learn magic tricks and to travel!
